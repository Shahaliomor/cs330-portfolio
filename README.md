## CS 330 Module Eight Reflection

### 1. How do I approach designing software?

This project strengthened my practical design skills by teaching me how to translate a real-world reference into a fully realized 3D environment. I learned to break the design into parts — choosing familiar objects like a notebook, pen, coffee cup, and binders — and plan how to build them using basic 3D shapes. I used careful positioning, scaling, and texturing to make the scene realistic and meaningful. My design process combined research (finding a reference image), sketching object placement, and using modular code for repeatable patterns. These tactics help me approach future design work more thoughtfully, balancing visual accuracy with performance and clean structure.

### 2. How do I approach developing programs?

For development, I used iterative building and testing. I started with simple shapes, then added details like textures, lighting, and camera navigation step by step. Each milestone refined my code and made the scene more polished. I applied new OpenGL techniques, projection modes, and user controls for interaction. Iteration helped me catch issues early and improve my coding style. Over the project, my development approach shifted from just making it work to making it clean, modular, and reusable — using organized functions like `SetupSceneLights()` and `RenderScene()` that I can adapt for future graphics work.

### 3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

This project gave me new skills in computational graphics and visualizations that connect directly to my educational and career goals. Learning how to build a scene with lighting, materials, textures, and camera control deepened my understanding of 3D rendering and OpenGL. I can apply these skills to future courses in graphics, game development, or simulation. Professionally, this work shows my ability to design, build, and explain an interactive 3D environment — a skill valuable for software roles that involve graphics or visualization, from game design to simulation to UI development.
